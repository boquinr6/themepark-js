                <!-- This should be roughly first person. Wake up in bed looking at maybe a window.-->

                <div id="intro">
                    Good morning... er, what's your name again?
                    <br>
                    <div class="codetext">var name = "<input type="text", id="charNameInput" class="codebox">";</div>

                <!-- The clothes are laid out on the bed. Probably a generic tshirt to change the color of,
                     jeans, and a pair of generic sneakers (bonus points for sneakers also changing color). -->

                    Right! Good morning, <div id="charName" style="display:inline; float: none;"></div>! What you just did was declaring and assigning a <b>variable</b>. A variable is a container for some value that we can use whenever we want. Variables are declared with the keyword <div class="codetext">var</div>. You can name them whatever you want. Variables are assigned with the equals sign (<div class="codetext">=</div>). Also notice the words and text box that are colored differently. Blue text represents code, and the gray boxes with blue text are areas where you can write code.

                <button id="nextPage0Button">Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></button>

                <div id="getReady">
                    Now that you've learned how to declare and assign variables, it's time to decide what to wear. Declare a variable, <div class="codetext">shirtColor</div>, and assign it to <div class="codetext">"red"</div>, <div class="codetext">"green"</div>, <div class="codetext">"blue"</div>, or <div class="codetext">"yellow"</div>. As a refresher, this is how to declare and assign a variable: <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="codetext">var variableName = value;</div> <br>
                    <br>
                    Remember to end your line with a semicolon (<div class="codetext">;</div>) Try assigning <div class="codetext">shirtColor</div> to different values on different lines to see what happens.
                    <br>
                    <textarea rows="4" cols="50" id="shirtColorInput" class="codebox"></textarea>
                    <br>
                    <button id="changeShirtColorButton">Execute Code</button>
                </div>
                <button id="nextPage1Button">Next <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></button>

                <!-- Have items place on a table, either on individual plates or one big one. Do it so
                     it's as if you are looking at the top of the table, so most of the screen is taken
                     up by it. -->

                <div id="eatBreakfast">
                    Breakfast time! Declare variables representing how much you eat for breakfast below. You can choose from <div class="codetext">toast</div>, <div class="codetext">eggs</div>, <div class="codetext">bacon</div>, and <div class="codetext">waffles</div>. For example,
                    <br>
                    <br> <div class="codetext">var toast = 2;</div> <br>
                    <br>
                    means you want to eat 2 pieces of toast. Keep in mind you can only stomach up to 5 pieces of each food, and you can't eat negative pieces. Declare and assign each variable on a separate line.
                    <br>
                    <textarea rows="8" cols="50" id="breakfastItemsInput" class="codebox">
// This is a comment. Unlike other lines of code
// you've written, comments will never be run,
// so you can write whatever you want in them.
// Write your breakfast code below</textarea>

                </div>

                <!-- Same table view as before, but this time display the text somewhere on the screen, with
                     all the items that were laid out before still there. -->

                <div id="totalBreakfast">
                    How much did you eat for breakfast? Let's create a new variable, <div class="codetext">total</div>, to represent how much you ate. Make sure you add up all your breakfast variables by finishing the line below.
                    <br>
                    <textarea rows="2", cols="50", class="codebox", id="totalBreakfastItemsInput">var total = toast + ;</textarea>

                <!-- This can be the same table, but all the food should be cleared. There should be
                     one glass of orange juice already on the table. -->

                <div id="drinkOrangeJuice">
                    Wash down your breakfast with some orange juice. Start with drinking one glass.<br>
                    <div class="codetext">var orangeJuice = 1;</div>
                    <br>To drink more, reassign <div class="codetext">orangeJuice</div> by adding to it. For example,
                    <br> <div class="codetext">orangeJuice = orangeJuice + 1; <br>
                    </div> means you drink one more glass. You only have enough orange juice left in the fridge to drink 5 total glasses.
